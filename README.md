Barclay's Hackathon

Steps to Install:

        => You can Unzip the above file 
        => Navigate into the app, run yarn install (Preferred as I used yarn) or npm install ==> (to Install dependencies)
        => Run yarn start or npm start ==> (to Start the Application)

Functionalities of the app:

        => Table Listing all books (Pagination limited to 100)
        => Used Typescript to code
        => Search Implemented to find all the book with author name and title (accepts both lower and uppercase)
        => Cart Added
        => To sort each column click on column header
        => To show or remove a column click on option (three vertical dots) in column header and select hide/show columns
        => MatrialUi Framework used
        => Created Backend Server in Node js to combine the Api's
